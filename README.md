**Benchmark Vector Optimizations**  
is a .NET console application that benchmarks various vector techniques used in AI applications and their impact on performance.
Requirements:  
- .NET 8 SDK (.NET 6 SDK is only required to build & run .NET 6 vs 8 runtime performance benchmark)  
- Visual Studio 2022 (tested on 17.9 Preview 2.1)  
- No OpenAI, Azure OpenAI or other "AI or cloud" keys required. Benchmark was done to mimic performance using simple internal generated vectors
